Title: Adjusted ggplots that effectively deal with outliers
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Edwin Thoen
Maintainer: Edwin Thoen <edwinthoen@gmail.com>
Description: Outliers can distort plots, preventing interpretation of the regular
  range. Simply omitting the outliers can give the impression the 
  data points are not there. The custom plots in this package collapse
  the outliers to single element, such that both the regular range is 
  can be interpreted, and the presence of outliers is noted.
